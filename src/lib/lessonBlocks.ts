// A lesson is an ordered sequence of teaching blocks, designed around its
// topic, rather than one fixed template. This file is the shape of a stored
// lesson, shared by server and browser; lessonDesign.ts holds the writing
// guide and validation.
//
// Storage stays compatible with everything that reads lessons:
// - `questions` still holds the graded knowledge checks (2-4), so server-side
//   grading and course progress work unchanged. A "check" block places one
//   of them inline, at the point in the lesson where it belongs.
// - `activities` still holds the typed interactive activities; an "activity"
//   block places one.
// - Lessons saved before blocks existed have no `blocks`; lessonBlocks()
//   rebuilds their original order (concepts, activities, quiz at the end).
