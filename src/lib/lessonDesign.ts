export const LESSON_GUIDE = `DESIGN THIS LESSON AROUND ITS TOPIC. There is no fixed template.

1. APPROACH. Pick the ONE teaching approach that best fits THIS module's content and set "approach"
   (and a one-sentence "approachReason"). The approach must visibly shape the lesson: a learner
   should be able to tell which one you chose from the sequence alone. Options and what each does:
${APPROACH_KEYS.map((k) => `   - ${k}: ${APPROACHES[k]}. Shape: ${APPROACH_MOVES[k]}.`).join("\n")}
   Choose from the content, not habit: a procedure suits worked_example or practice; a widely
   misunderstood idea suits misconception; a pivotal event suits case_study or story; a trade-off
   suits compare or scenario; a quantity that changes suits simulation; an abstract argument suits
   socratic. Fit the subject: programming is learned by reading, predicting, tracing and fixing real
   code; history through causes, sources, perspectives and chronology; science through phenomena,
   models and quantities; strategy through decisions, incentives and payoffs.
   If the tutor lists approaches used in earlier modules, choose a different one unless it truly fits better.

2. BLOCKS. Write "blocks": 5-12 blocks in teaching order, moving from exploration to understanding
   to application. Use only the kinds this lesson needs; never pad with filler. Every block has all
   fields; leave unused ones empty ("" / [] / 0, and "correct": false, "line": 0 in items).
   - explain: heading, body = the explanation (2-6 sentences; separate paragraphs with a blank line),
     aside = an optional concrete example. Define a term only when the learner needs it.
   - activity: ref = index into "activities" (0-based). Each activity is placed by exactly one block.
   - check: a graded knowledge check placed right after the idea it tests. ref = index into
     "questions"; hints = 1-2 progressive hints that nudge without giving the answer away;
     aside = a different way to explain the idea, shown if the learner gets it wrong.
   - worked: a worked example revealed step by step. heading, body = the problem, items = 2-5 steps
     (label = step title, text = what to do, detail = why), aside = the final answer.
   - code: real, correct code in a small window. language (e.g. "python"), code = 3-15 lines,
     body = the task, mode = one of:
       "predict": what does it output? items = 3-4 options (text = an exact output, correct = true for
         exactly one, detail = feedback on that choice).
       "bug": the code has one bug; items = 3-4 candidate fixes (text), exactly one correct, detail = feedback.
       "trace": step through execution; items = 3-8 steps, line = 1-based line number being run,
         text = what happens, detail = variable state after it, like "i = 2, total = 3".
     aside = the explanation shown at the end; hints = 0-2 hints. Outputs and traces must be exactly
     what the code really does. Use code blocks for programming topics, not for others.
   - compare: heading, body = one-line intro, columns = exactly 2 column names, items = 3-6 rows
     (label = the aspect, text = first column, detail = second column).
   - reflect: an open question the learner answers in their own words. heading, body = the question,
     aside = a strong model answer they compare against afterwards.
   - dialogue: a short Socratic exchange. heading, items = 3-8 turns (label = speaker, text = line).
   - summary: heading, items = 2-4 takeaways (text). Only if it adds something; never just repeat.

3. RULES FOR THE SEQUENCE
   - Don't open or close every lesson the same way. Open with whatever this approach needs: a puzzle,
     a story, a scenario, code to read, a claim to challenge, a problem to solve, a short explanation.
     End where the approach lands: the mystery's answer, the learner's own solution, the last turn of
     the story, a hard final check, a reflection. A summary is optional, not a habit.
   - Length follows the content: a tight idea may need 5 blocks, a rich one 11. Use 2, 3 or 4 checks
     as the idea needs. Only use a block kind if this lesson is better for it.
   - Spread the knowledge checks through the lesson at natural points. At least one check must come
     before the last teaching block; never stack them all at the end. They get harder as the lesson goes:
     early ones apply one idea, later ones combine ideas or transfer them to a new situation.
   - At least 2 hands-on blocks (activity, code, worked, reflect) besides the checks.
   - Never use the same activity type twice, and don't put two blocks of the same kind back to back
     unless the sequence genuinely needs it. No more than 2 explain blocks in a row.

QUESTIONS (the graded checks): 2-4, each placed by exactly one check block. Each is scenario-based
(a short realistic situation that asks the learner to apply the idea, never a definition to recall),
has EXACTLY 4 distinct options, a correctAnswer that is an EXACT copy of one option, and a 1-2 sentence
explanation of why it is right.

ACTIVITIES: 1-4, each placed by one activity block, each a different type that fits the topic.
